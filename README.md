# sudokuSolver
A short sudoku solver that I wrote. I can overhaul the functionality to make it run on command line and take a text file as an input for ease of testing. As it is currently, 
this was my first stab at it so it's absolutely not optimized. I did some research (basically a quick google search lol) to see if there was any way to avoid just brute forcing
it but I couln't find anything. You could probably do something with a decision tree but I haven't given it much thought, it was just a fun side project.
